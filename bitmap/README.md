# Bitmap: Functional Pictures

wargrey

```racket
 (require bitmap) package: [graphics](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/graphics)
```

> The `bitmap` is influenced by `pict` and `images/flomap`.

The `bitmap` is a typed functional picture library which wraps \[Cairo\]
and \[Pango\] directly. The initial motivation is to provide high
performance, professional, yet handy graphics APIs that suitable to work
with my `css` engine as well as to be used standalone by developers and
artists.

​_WARNING: This library is still experimental and everything is subject
to change._​

​_WARNING: To keep compatible with other Racket picture libraries is not
the goal._​
